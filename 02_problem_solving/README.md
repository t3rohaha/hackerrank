## Time Complexity

A way to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm by calculating how the runtime
grows as input grows.

`WORST-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY` - Maximum amount of runtime for given input size.

`BIG O NOTATION` - Typically used to express time complexity.

`O(1)` - The runtime does not change depending on input size.

`O(n)`- The runtime grows linearly.
